# IronCore

**IronVk** is a Vulkan-first, C++ graphics framework that aims to remove the complexity of Vulkan initialization while keeping its raw power.  
Inspired by the configuration-first approachs. IronVk lets you define your rendering setup through clean, structured configs — from swapchain creation to pipeline layouts — without diving deep into repetitive Vulkan boilerplate.

Whether you're a beginner exploring Vulkan or a pro who wants a rapid prototyping tool, IronVk helps you **forge high-performance graphics** with a streamlined workflow.
